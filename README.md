# Project_Euler_1_to_100
Project Euler solutions to problems 1 through 100 written in Haskell.

I solved these problems as I was learning to program in Haskell.

The solutions are found for all 100 problems in about 7 seconds running
on a 3.2Ghz machine from about 2015.

I solved these from 2014 to 2016. After figuring out how to solve each
problem, my focus was on writing a solution that was both efficient and
used the purity of functional programming in Haskell.

I used a Makefile and the cabal system for packages to manage libraries
and the build process.

Some solutions are commented well and others not very much...
